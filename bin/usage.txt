usage: sillyscope OPTIONS

  Show a scanning spectrograph from 32-bit little-endian float data from stdin.

  where OPTIONS are:

    --range=START-END
    
      Limit the vertical axis between START and END in Hz.
      You can use `k` as short-hand for 1000s. Default: 0-44k.

    --rate=RATE

      Expect RATE bytes per second as input. Default: 44k.

    --samples=SAMPLES

      Use SAMPLE many samples each sweep of the fft.
      More samples will be slower but higher resolution.
      Default: 11k.
